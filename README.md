# Bay Wheels visualization project
## by Tien Duong


## Dataset

The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize the `lyfy_bike_data.csv`. This project is part of the Udacity's Data analysis program. The Dataset contain 13 columns and 154967 rows that extracted from the lyft webpage under bay-wheel >https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels/system-data<. The dataset consist of `longtitude` and `latitude` coordinates. Ride_type and ID under `ride_id` and `ride_type`. Start_station_name and ID under `start_station_name` and `start_station_name_id`. End_station_name and ID under `end_station_name` and `end_station_name_id`. Membership type under `member_casual`.

## Summary

In the finding of my analysis, I was able to observe the different type of user behaviors between member and non member on different day of the week. Majority of the rides operate on Friday and Saturday by non-member and majority prefer using the electric bike over normal bike. Also by looking into the coordinates graph with time duration, majority of rides happen in San Francisco downtown city. 


## Insights

I stumbled upon many dead-end analysis during the analysis process, but I manage to get back on track and found some valuable insight from this dataset. This dataset give us the advantage of user's behavior that can help make business decision that bases on data driven methodologies. Only if I have more data from the prior and after months so that I can conduct and pre and post evaluation to compares for the correlation and changes bases on user's behaviors.
